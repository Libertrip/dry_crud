Thank you for using dry_crud. Feel free to adapt all generated classes to 
your needs. To integrate dry_crud into your code, only a few additions are 
required:

 * For uniform CRUD functionallity, just subclass your controllers from 
   CrudController. 
 * To use standard formatting, tables and forms throughout your
   application, add 'helper :standard' to your ApplicationController and 
   benefit everywhere from these little helper methods. 
 * Add a #label method to your models for a human-friendly representation.

Enjoy dry_crud and stay DRY!
