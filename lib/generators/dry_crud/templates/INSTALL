Thank you for using dry_crud. Feel free to adapt all generated classes to 
your needs. To integrate dry_crud into your code, only a few additions are 
required:

 * For uniform CRUD functionallity, just subclass your controllers from 
   CrudController. 
 * Overwrite the :to_s method of your models for a human-friendly
   representation.


Enjoy dry_crud and stay DRY!
