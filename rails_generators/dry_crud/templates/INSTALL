Thank you for using dry_crud. Feel free to adapt all generated classes to 
your needs. To integrate dry_crud into your code, only a few additions are 
required:

 * To use a standard formatting, tables and forms throught your application, 
   add 'helper :standard' to your ApplicationController. 
 * To get uniform CRUD functionallity, just subclass your controllers from 
   CrudController. 
 * Add a :label method to your models for a human-friendly representation.

Kepp stuff DRY!
